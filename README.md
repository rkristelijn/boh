###Undrian plateau

Find Majerio's quests.
 
'The glowing stones', find much harder opponants that face right instead of left.
 
Heart of the Abian (Ebian Forrest), Dunia's Meadow (Glenfort Plains), The Energy Mine (The Cursed Quarry) (Dragonmoor), The Canyon of Shadows, Flame Cavern (The Urgesh Mountains)
 
Complete 'What the flux', 'who gives a flux', 'morbid analysis', 'shoot the messenger' and then all three of the 'Old Wounds' quests, once you have completed the last 'Old Wounds' quests the Plateau will unlock for you 

The flux quests are a lot easier now that it has been reduced to 3 of each flux instead of 5, but still takes a lot of time farming those portals, but remember you can buy 5 of each flux from the black market on wednesday and saturday if you prefer to buy your way out of a tedious quest.

Morbid Analysis is the one that kills me now, need to kill 100 vile, so its back into the portals to spend around 70 - 80 energy on killing vile, the tough bit about this quest is that if you try to get it all in one portal then you will hit the final incursion level which can be tough for players that haven't got there might up very far yet, so might be easier for weaker players to just complete the first couple levels of a few different portals (this method is more time consuming, but a lot easier on the health pots and without the fear of death).

'Shoot the messenger' and all three of the 'Old Wounds' quests cost 10 energy each and are all 5 wave dungeons, fairly straight forward and gives you a nice little back story of what the vile gate is and what lies beyond it.

###The Shards of Ironhaven
Find the Shard…in Glenfort Plains – Eldritch Symbols I quest (lvl 8)
Find the Shard…in Ebian Forest – Eldritch Symbols II quest (lvl 10)
Find the Shard…in Cursed Quarry – Eldritch Symbols III quest (lvl 11)
Find the Shard…in Urgresh Mountains – Eldritch Symbols IV (lvl 14)
Find the Shard…in Lake Nithus – Eldritch Symbols V (19)
`
Eldritch Symbols I - Prelude: Quest Skars Revenge III leads to strange grotto in Glenfort Plains.
Objectives:Use the treasure map to find the ancient door – I found this in the Old Library during another quest.
Map can also be found by defeating Skar in Plagueriders Pass.
Solve the riddle to learn where the door key is located – Glenfort Plains, The Fallow Fields
When complete, turn into the strange grotto and the Unlocked Grotto will appear, enter and defeat the Eldritch Guardian. He will drop your first Shard.
 
Eldritch Symbols II - Prelude: Quest: Scout Work – turn into Bandit camp in Ebian Forest. Quest: Bribery – Purchase the golden arrow from Majerios shop listed under Speicals (100 silver). Turn this quest into Bandit Camp. Quest: Lockbolt – Defeat Lockbolt and receive Ebian Treasure Map.
Objectives: Treasure Map finds ancient door – auto achieved + see below
All three seals can be found in Ebian Forest – Entrance, Clearing and Deep Wood. You should only have to visit each area once, battle one wave/mob, than leave and go to next area. Unlocked Grotto - defeat Eldritch Guardian. He drops the second shard.
 
Eldritch Symbol III - Prelude: Quest: Bloodstone Burrow – Cursed Quarry, Bloodstone Burrow. Complete this quest and map will drop. This will open the Rocky Grotto
Objectives:  Visit Majerios shop. Under Specials, purchase the ring then return to Cursed Quarry. Return quest to Rocky Grotto. Unlocked Grotto – defeat Eldritch Guardian and he will drop the third shard.
 
Eldritch Symbol IV - Prelude: Enter and complete the dungeon – The Cliffs of Zuur in Urgresh Mountains. After defeating Zurr, he will drop the map. This will open the Mountainous Grotto.
Objectives: Ancient door opened w/treasure map – auto achieved. All four items can be found in Urgresh Mountains – Urgresh Peaks. Turn in quest to Mountainous Grotto. Unlocked Grotto is opened – Enter and defeat Eldritch Guardian, he will then drop the fourth shard.
 
Eldritch Symbols V - Prelude: Complete The Glenmire Staff line of quests. For me this line began at level 16. It begins with Storm the Castle and ends with Shores of the Lost City, level 19. Prelude: After turning in the quest, Shores of the Lost City you will receive a quest called The Golem. He is located in Lake Nithus, in the center where the cave used to be. After defeating him, he will drop the Nithus Treasure Map. This will open the Underwater Grotto. Enter and receive last Eldritch quest. Turn in Golem quest to Daedalus and receive quest Defeat Lord Helion. Head back to Lake Nithus.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: When turning in The Golem quest, you will receive a quest to Defeat Lord Helion. Do Not do this quest until you receive Eldritch Symbols V quest from the Grotto – items needed for Eldritch will be dropped in Lord Helion’s Temple (dungeon).
 
Objectives:  Treasure map to find ancient door – Auto achieved, Items to break 1st seal – Red Stones – dropped by Gate Keepers – Helion’s Dungeon. Items to break 2nd seal – Blue Stones – dropped by Waterlogged Corpses – The Grieving Glades
Items to break 3rd seal – Yellow Stones – dropped by Skeletal Assassins – Helion’s Dungeon. Turn in completed Eldritch V quest in Underwater Grotto. Unlocked Grotto opens – Enter and defeat the Eldritch Guardian – He will drop the last/5th shard.
